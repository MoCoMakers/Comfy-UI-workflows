# About

Find workflows you can import into ComfyUI in the "workflows" folder. Please pay careful attention to this project's REQUIRED_Downloads.md because workflows also depend on models and downloaded third party resources.

It is strongly recommended to install https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager to help you find "missing" node types and install them.

ComfyUI was tested with:

NVIDIA GPU with at least 8GB memory, CUDA 11.8

Installation is complex, and time-consuming. You need a good internet connection the first time queries run, as various models are cached.

Expect 20GB+ of disk space required. (No less than 10GB).

For more details, see the included 'ComfyUI Guide.pptx'
